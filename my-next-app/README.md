## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.6 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
 - **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Realtime Database, Storage)

## Getting Started

First, configure environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
2. The example is pre-filled with your Firebase project's public keys. Adjust if needed.
3. Optionally add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` if you plan to use Google sign-in via NextAuth.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Firebase Usage

Firebase is initialized in `src/lib/firebase.ts` and exports:

- `auth` (Firebase Authentication)
- `database` (Realtime Database)
- `storage` (Cloud Storage)
- `googleProvider` (GoogleAuthProvider for client sign-in flows)

Usage example:

```ts
import { auth, database } from "@/lib/firebase"
```
