## ✅ Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
https://console.firebase.google.com/

### Step 2: Navigate to Rules
1. Select your project
2. Click **Realtime Database**
3. Click **Rules** tab

### Step 3: Copy These Rules
Open file: `COPY_PASTE_FIREBASE_RULES.json` and copy ALL content

### Step 4: Paste & Publish
1. DELETE all old rules
2. PASTE new rules
3. Click **Publish** button
4. Wait for "Rules published successfully" ✅

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to farmer dashboard
2. Click "Seed Sample Products"
3. Should see: ✅ "Successfully seeded 6 sample products!"

## 🎯 What Changed?

### New Structure
```
/products                    ← New flat collection
  /{productId}
    - farmerId: "farmer123"  ← Links to owner
    - name: "Tomatoes"
    - price: 50
    - ...
```

### Old Structure (Removed)
```
/farmers
  /{farmerId}
    /products               ← No longer used
      /{productId}
```

## 🔐 Security Rules

```json
"products": {
  ".read": true,
  ".indexOn": ["farmerId", "category", "isActive"],
  "$productId": {
    ".write": "auth != null && (
      !data.exists() && newData.child('farmerId').val() == auth.uid ||
      data.exists() && data.child('farmerId').val() == auth.uid
    )"
  }
}
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Everyone can READ products (public marketplace)
- ✅ Farmers can CREATE products (if farmerId matches their auth.uid)
- ✅ Farmers can UPDATE/DELETE only THEIR products
- ❌ Cannot create products for other farmers
- ❌ Cannot edit other farmers' products
