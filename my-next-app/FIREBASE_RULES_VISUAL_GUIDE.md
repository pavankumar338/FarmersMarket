## 🧪 VERIFY IT WORKED

### Test 1: Check Rules Are Published

```
Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules

Should see your new rules (with farmers, organizations, etc.)
```

### Test 2: Check Anonymous Auth

```
Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method

Anonymous should show: ✅ Enabled
```

### Test 3: Test in Your App

```
1. Open your app: http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in as farmer
3. Try to add a product
4. Should work without "Permission Denied" error
```

---

## 🎨 What The Rules Look Like

### Before (Default):
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

### After (Your New Rules):
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": false,
    "users": { ... },
    "farmers": { ... },
    "organizations": { ... },
    "products": { ... },
    "orders": { ... }
  }
}
```

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Rules Are Active

### Method 1: Visual Check
```
Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules

Look for:
- "farmers" section ✅
- "organizations" section ✅
- "products" section ✅
- "orders" section ✅
```

### Method 2: Check in Data Tab
```
Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Data

Try to add data manually:
- If rules work, you can add to your sections
- If wrong rules, you'll see "Permission Denied"
```

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:

- Forget to click "Publish"
- Skip enabling Anonymous auth
- Modify rules manually

### ✅ DO:
- Copy ALL content from firebase.rules.json
- Click "Publish" button

   ```
   Make sure you're in the correct Firebase project!

   If there are errors, re-copy from firebase.rules.json
   ```

   ```
   Realtime Database → Data
   Should show: us-central1 or your region
   ```

If using Firebase Console on mobile:
```
1. Use landscape mode for better view
2. Rules editor is smaller but works same way
3. Copy/paste still works
